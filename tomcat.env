# Tomcat Logger Level
# https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/logging.html
# A handler's log level threshold is INFO by default and can be set by using:
# SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST or ALL. 
#
# The output range above is: (left to right)
# Lowest level (least amount of output) = SEVERE
# Highest level (most amount of output) = ALL
# Recommended default levels to be WARNING (production grade)
# Change levels to FINEST or ALL for debugging purposes only
#
# Please note the log level changes of FINEST or all can drastically increase the following:
# disk activity, memory usage, Java memory usage and network activity. 
#
# Use these logs for general purpose debugging
