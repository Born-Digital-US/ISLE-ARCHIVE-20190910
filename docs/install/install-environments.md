# Overview: ISLE Installation Environments

As of the ISLE `1.2.0` release, ISLE now has the option to use clearly defined but different environments based on enduser's needs. Depending on the environment choice, additional configuration changes will need to be made to ISLE configuration files, domain names, etc. When an ISLE enduser is ready to progress past using the default Demo environment, it is recommended that their learning path and workflow proceed in this suggested order.

* **Demo** - *Default* - Used for trying out ISLE for the first time, having a sandbox for tests etc

* **Local** - Used for Drupal site development, more extensive metadata, Solr and Fedora development work on a personal computer

* **Staging** - Used for remote (non-local / cloud) hosting of a Staging site. Islandora Drupal site code here is almost finished but viewed privately prior to pushing to public Production. Fedora data might have tests collections.

* **Production** - Used for remote (non-local / cloud) hosting of a Production site. Site and collections are public and accessible to the world. Drupal site code is finished, functional and polished. Fedora data has full non test collections. Test collections are not recommended here.

* **Test** - Used by ISLE Maintainers for testing ISLE releases, pull releases and ISLE development, etc.

## ISLE Project Structure

ISLE endusers will make the appropriate changes to the values found in the ISLE project `.env` to be able to define and launch their working environment. This `.env` should then have values that point to an corresponding `docker-compose.*.yml` file. As you can see from the root of the ISLE project now (ISLE version 1.2.0+), there additional `docker-compose` files that match an environment as well as additional named `.env` files. Below is a potential outline of all the files that an ISLE enduser might have to edit, change or add as a result of choosing an environment. (_Subject to change_)

* `.env` -

## ISLE Environments `.env` reference

Please note this section is for reference only when are ISLE endusers making changes. In some cases, environment descriptions and settings are suggestions not actual values. ISLE endusers can copy values to the Activated ISLE environment section within the ISLE project `.env`.

### Demo

* Used for trying out ISLE for the first time, having a sandbox for tests, etc.

* The Demo environment is the "default" activated environment.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle_demo
BASE_DOMAIN=isle.localdomain
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=ld
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.demo.yml
```

---

### Local

* Used for Drupal site development, more extensive metadata, Solr and Fedora development work on a personal computer

* To use this environment, change the values in the Activated ISLE environment to match the values described below and save the file.

* Inline comments below are merely suggestions except for the mandatory `COMPOSE_FILE` value. Otherwise change however you see fit. Do not copy the comments (#) below when editing the main `.env`, simply add the suggested or mandatory values as directed to the right of any `=`.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=                 # (Suggested) Add an identifiable project or institutional name plus environment e.g. acme_digital_local
BASE_DOMAIN=                          # (Suggested) This is not a real domain and can be anything, so add your institution name only e.g. acme.localdomain
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=ld                 # (Mandatory)
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.local.yml # (Mandatory) The docker-compose file used for configuring and launching the Local environment.
```

---

### Staging

* Used for remote (non-local / cloud) hosting of a Staging site. Code here is almost finished but viewed privately prior to pushing to public Production.

* Please read through the `docker-compose.staging.yml` file as there are bind mount points that need to be configured on the host machine, to ensure data persistence. There are suggested bind mounts that the end-user can change to fit their needs or they can setup additional volumes or disks to match the suggestions.

* To use this environment, change the values in the Activated ISLE environment lines to match the values described below and save the file.

* Inline comments below are merely suggestions except for the mandatory `COMPOSE_FILE` value. Otherwise change however you see fit. Do not copy the comments (#) below when editing the main `.env`, simply add the suggested or mandatory values as directed to the right of any `=`.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=                   # (Suggested) Add an identifiable project or institutional name plus environment e.g. acme_digital_stage
BASE_DOMAIN=                            # (Suggested) Add the full production domain here e.g. digital-staging.institution.edu
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=                     # (Suggested) Make an easy to read acronym from the letters of your institution and collection names plus environment e.g. (acme digitalcollections staging) is acdcs
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.staging.yml # (Mandatory) The docker-compose file used for configuring and launching the Staging environment.
```

### Production

* Used for remote (non-local / cloud) hosting of a Production site. Site and collections are public and accessible to the world.

* Please read through the `docker-compose.production.yml` file as there are bind mount points that need to be configured on the host machine, to ensure data persistence. There are suggested bind mounts that the end-user can change to fit their needs or they can setup additional volumes or disks to match the suggestions.

* To use this environment, change the values in the Activated ISLE environment to match the values described below and save the file.

* Inline comments below are merely suggestions except for the mandatory `COMPOSE_FILE` value. Otherwise change however you see fit. Do not copy the comments (#) below when editing the main `.env`, simply add the suggested or mandatory values as directed to the right of any `=`.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=                      # (Suggested) Add an identifiable project or institutional name plus environment e.g. acme_digital_prod
BASE_DOMAIN=                               # (Suggested) Add the full production domain here e.g. digital.institution.edu
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=                        # (Suggested) Make an easy to read acronym from the letters of your institution and collection names plus environment e.g. (acme digitalcollections prod) is acdcp
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.production.yml # (Mandatory) The docker-compose file used for configuring and launching the Production environment.
```

### Test

* Used by ISLE Maintainers for testing ISLE releases, pull releases and ISLE development, etc.

* To use this environment, change the values in the Activated ISLE environment to match the values described below and save the file.

* All values below are mandatory. Do not change. Simply fill them in as directed. Do not copy the comments (#) below when editing the main `.env`, simply add the suggested or mandatory values as directed to the right of any `=`.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isle_test       # (Mandatory)
BASE_DOMAIN=isle.localdomain         # (Mandatory)
CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=td                # (Mandatory)
